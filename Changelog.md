## v13.502.2
* Clarification on Actor References in Evaluations
  * Use `opponentActor` to access the opponent‚Äôs rollData during evaluations, instead of `targetActor`.
    * `targetActor` remains available for backwards compatibility, but its usage is now discouraged.
  * This change hopefully improves clarity, especially in cases like saving throws, where the actor rolling the save *can* also be the target of an item roll. For example:
    * during an attack, you have a clear distinction between the attacking actor and the targeted actor.
    * But during saves, the actor rolling the save can also be an actual target, and the other party (e.g., the spellcaster or trap) is better referred to as the opponent.
* Fix for wrong localization string in some settings
* Refactor setpieces code
* Rework `_canSee()` 
* Raging/silenced/incapacitated etc checks fixes
  * `raging`, `silenced`, `no armor proficiency` checks for spell items use
  * `incapacitated` will be checked for activities that have any relevant action as activation cost
* Fix for `subjectTokenId` undefined when no message is created (like initiative rolls)
* Update pt-BR.json by @Kharmans
* Pre use activity issues cleanup
  * the targeting options for attack changes slightly. Now the module will:
    * Use source actor data only if zero or multiple targets are selected when attacking
    * Cancel roll silently
    * Cancel roll with a warning notification shown to the user's client
      * In all cases a console warning will be shown in the user's client

## v13.502.1
* Compatibility bump for v5.0.2
* Small fix for not posting more than one warnings, for incapacitated/raging/silenced checks
* Make sure that group or vehicle actors do not break processing
* Updated Italian translation by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) ü§ó
  
## v13.501.1.1
* Updated Polish translation by [Lioheart](<https://github.com/Lioheart>) ü§ó
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) ü§ó
  
## v13.501.1
* Deal with Foundry v13 and dnd5e v5.0.0 deprecations
* Update compatibility and verify module for Foundry v13.342 and 5e v5.0.1
* Exhaustion automation setting will be only available for 5e legacy rules
* New GM setting for visibility of the tooltips in chat messages
  * `All`: players will see tooltips in all chat messages, no matter the actor rolling
  * `None`: players won't see any tooltips in chat messages
  * `Owned`: a player will be able to see tooltips in chat messages for rolls from owned actors
  * `Players`: players will be able to see tooltips in chat messages for rolls from all player owned actors
* Settings tweaks, so Show tooltip module name and Show chat messages tooltips options are available, only when relevant.

## v13.500.4.1
* Hotfix for `ui` in `equippedItems` triggering an error collection...
* Hotfix for the changelog showing an incorrect example of `equippedItems` usage
  * corrected example: `rollingActor.equippedItems.filter(i => i.includes('Platinum')).length > 2` will be true when the rolling actor has more than 2 equipped items with their names including `Platinum`

## v13.500.4
* Guards against `aura` or `grants` flags being evaluated against non relevant actors
* Guards against numerous deprecation warnings being generated for `attributes.spelldc` and `attributes.spellmod` which AC5e doesn't use, but inadvertently triggers when cloning actor.getRollData() objects
* Guards against cases of `undefined: true` being present in the sandbox data
* Adds for flag evaluations:
  * `equippedItems` which is an Array of item names, currently equipped on the actor
    * ie `rollingActor.equippedItems.filter(i => i.includes('Platinum')).length > 2` which will be true when the rolling actor has more than 2 equipped items with their names including `Platinum`
  * `distance` for distance evaluations
    * `distance > 15 && distance <= 20` would be true if the distance between the rolling token and opponent token is between 15 (excluded) and 20 (included), but only when distance is available 
  * `allies`/`enemies` as evaluation conditions for non auras too
     * `allies` will be true for rolls that the rolling token has the **same** disposition compared to its opponent (if an opponent is available for that roll)
     * `enemies` will be true for rolls that the rolling token has a **different** disposition compared to its opponent (if an opponent is available for that roll)
* Updated Italian translation by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) ü§ó
* Updated Polish translation by [Lioheart](<https://github.com/Lioheart>) ü§ó

## v13.500.3.3
* Damage hook hotfix

## v13.500.3.2
* Some more bugfixes for attack hooks
* Fix for `effectOriginTokenId` evaluations
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) ü§ó

## v13.500.3.1
* Normalize roll data evaluations for ac5e flags
 * In bonus mode flags, use:
  * `@` or `rollingActor` to access roll data from the actor rolling, ie `@abilities.dex.mod` or `rollingActor.dex.mod`
  * `##` or `targetActor` to access roll data from a targeted actor (single targeted actor), ie `##attributes.ac.bonus` or `targetActor.attributes.ac.bonus`
  * for auras only, `auraActor` to access roll data from the aura's source actor, ie `auraActor.abilities.cha.mod`
   * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.aura.save.bonus | Override | radius=10;bonus=auraActor.abilities.cha.mod;includeSelf;singleAura;allies` is essentially the level 6 Paladin's Aura of Protection.
* Cleanup parameters pass to private functions
* Concentration flag fixes
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) ü§ó

## v13.500.2
* Updated Polish translation by [Lioheart](<https://github.com/Lioheart>) ü§ó
* Cleanup in available sandbox data for AC5e flags conditional evaluations
  * `canSee`: evaluates to true if the rolling actor can see the targeted actor
  * `isSeen`: evaluates to true if the targeted actor can see the rolling actor
  * `rollingActor` holds merged data from the `rollingActor.getRollData()` plus the rolling token
  * `targetActor` holds merged data from the `targetActor.getRollData()` plus the targeted token
* The evaluation data is a work in progress and to help users become acquainted, AC5e will be creating a log with its sandbox data everytime a condition evaluation is happening.
  * It will be disabled in the future when the WIKI is ready and the basic available data are set to stone! 

## v13.500.1
* Make sure that when removing blacklisted keywords, an empty string left for evaluation, always evaluates to `true`
  * as a side effect, leaving the effect value of any AC5e flags empty, it will also evaluate to `true`
* Only try to register DAE fields when DAE is actually active
* Foundry v13 and dnd5e 5.0.0 compatibility update
* Updated Italian translation by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) ü§ó

## v13.439.2
* Proper descriptions fix in DAE fields for auras `radius=`
* Fix for checks being based some times on targeted token's data
* AEs can be named the same and should all be counted
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) ü§ó

## v13.439.1.1
* Slightly more up to date DAE field descriptions for AC5e flags
* Properly evaluate `allies` and `enemies` keywords in flags. Omit for affecting all actors.

## v13.439.1
* That is a huge update, so there might be issues, so please let me know by creating issues in the github repository: [issues](<https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues>)
* üêæ If you like what I do, consider supporting this lonely bugbear! Every shiny gold coin helps keep the ideas flowing and the goblins at bay.

* Initial implementation for the system's actor abilities/checks roll modes for dis/advantage (not fully supported yet by the system).
  * AC5e will use notice and use any of these flags when present on the rolling actor. 
* AC5E flags:
  * Added flags with descriptions in DAE for autocompletion.
  * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.ACTIONTYPE.MODE`
    * ACTIONTYPE: can be one of `all/attack/check/concentration/damage/death/initiative/save/skill/tool`
    * MODE: can be one of `advantage/disadvantage/bonus/critical/fumble/success/fail`
    * These will be evaluated when the actor that has that active effect on, rolls any of the relevant ACTIONTYPE.
  * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.grants.ACTIONTYPE.MODE`
    * Same ACTIONTYPEs and MODEs as above
    * These will be evaluated when you target the actor that has that active effect on, _granting_ any rolls of the relevant ACTIONTYPE the corresponding MODE.
  * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.aura.ACTIONTYPE.MODE`
    * Same ACTIONTYPEs and MODEs as above
    * These will be evaluated when you are rolling one of the relevant ACTIONTYPEs and the token of an actor that has that active effect on, is in range!
    * The auras need in the change value of the active effect an entry of `radius=15;` for example, to designate the aura's range.
    * You can also include:
      * `singleAura` (mainly for bonus MODE): add that in to make sure that only 1 auras of the same name (the Active Effect's name) can affect the actor rolling, based on higher bonus or closer to the rolling token if of the same bonus.
      * `includeSelf`: add that in if the aura should affect also the actor that has that active effect on.
  * When using `bonus` mode, you should include a bonus entry in the change value, like `bonus=1d4 + abilities.dex.mod` or `bonus=-5[fire]` for typed damage MODE.
  * All the flags can should allow for sync conditional evaluations, based on data from:
    * `rollingActor.getRollData()`
      * If the rolling actor has for example 50 hp, `attributes.hp.value > 40` would evaluate to true
    * `opponentActor.getRollData()` when relevant and under `target`
      * If the target actor has for example 50 hp, `target.attributes.hp.value > 40` would evaluate to true
    * `activity.getRollData()` when relevant
    * `item.getRollData()` when relevant
    * `tokenSize` as the rolling `token.document.width * token.document.height`
    * `tokenElevation`
    * `race`: an Array of the rolling actor's `[value, subtype, swarm, custom, race]` data
    * `targetTokenSize` as the rolling `targetToken.document.width * targetToken.document.height`
    * `targetTokenElevation`
    * `targetRace` an Array of the target's actor's `[value, subtype, swarm, custom, race]` data
    * `activityDamageTypes` which should be returning all the damage types of the relevant activity
    * `activityAttackMode`
    * `activityEffectsStatusRiders` which is a Set of all the statuses that the activity might apply on the target if any
      * So if an attack would apply `poisoned` on a hit, an entry of `activityEffectsStatusRiders.poisoned` would evaluate to true
    * If a combat is active:
      * `isCombatTurn` is true when it's the rolling actor's turn
      * `target.isCombatTurn` same for the target
      * `combat.round/combat.turn/combat.current/combat.turns` will evaluate against the relevant paths in `game.combat`
    * `worldTime` the game.time.worldTime
    * `ability` the ability used on the roll
    * `skill` the skill used on the roll if relevant
    * `tool` the tool used on the roll if relevant
    * `spellLevel` the spell level of casting a spell or the base level of innate ones
  * You can use `ac5e.conditionData({subject: rollingActor, subjectToken: rollingToken, opponent: targetActpr, opponentToken: targetToken, item: rolledItem, activity: rolledActivity, options = {ability, skill, tool,})` to create an image of what data the sandbox for the conditional evaluations would hold.
* Added a generic enable checkbox in the setting for the colorful AC5e buttons
* Numerous smaller fixes.
* Addition of Polish translation and updates in Italian.

  - Heavy Encumbrance applies disadvantage.
  - War Caster named Item applies advantage.

## v11.315.304.7
Closes [63](https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues/63) with a new setting for `AC5e targeting options`. <br><br>
When 0 or more than 1 targets are selected, AC5e will not be able by default to calculate correctly advantageMode/damageMode as this is done based on the first of the `game.user.targets` only. There is now a setting for the GM to decide how AC5e will deal with targeting and rolling an Attack or Damage, or try to Use an Item that has an attack and Target any of the Individual target options in its details tab. The options are as follows:
   * `From Source Only`: The advantageMode/damageMode will be calculated based on effects/conditions etc on the Source actor only (___default option___),
   * `Do nothing`: No calculations whatsoever will take place,
   * `Enforce targeting`: Will cancel the incoming Roll or Item use, and display a warning for the user to target `1 Target` (___Use with caution___).


## v11.315.304.6.8
* Fix bug when rolling an attack and automated encumbrance is true.

## v11.315.304.6.7
* Default settings fix.
  * Tooltips on
  * Armor automation off

* Closing [57](https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues/57) (more translations about attack/damage rolls and targets selected).
* Closing [58](https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues/58) (bail out of attack/damage rolls suggestions, if no targets selected).

## v11.315.304.6.3
* Closes [53](https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues/53)
