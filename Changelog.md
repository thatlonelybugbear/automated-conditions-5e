## 13.504.8
* Compatibility bump Foundry v13.347
* Distance Calculation Rework for Hex, Gridless, and Square-gridded scenes:
  * Gridless distances greater than `canvas.grid.distance` but less than `canvas.grid.distance * 1.25` are considered equal to `canvas.grid.distance`.
    * Example: If grid distance is 5 ft, and a token is 5–6.25 ft away, it's treated as 5 ft — helpful for targeting when not enforcing strict distance.
  * Updated _getDistance method signature.
  * Reworked logic for `wallsBlocking` auras (new keyword)
* Keyword Matching is Now Case-Insensitive
  * Reworked `handleUses()` to support this change
  * You can now use `usesCount` or `usescount` or `UsEsCoUnT` etc
* Fixes for `includeSelf` and `allies`/`enemies` issues
* Added logic to consume uses from `Owned Items`. Use with:
 * `usesCount: origin, 2` consumes 2 uses from the origin item/activity.
 * `usesCount = itemOrActivityUUID, uses` consumes 1 or specified number of uses.
   * Comma-separated number = required number of available uses and how many to consume.
* Added `effectOriginActor` in available evaluation data as needed.
* Now supports dashes in keys (useful for scale value, eg `@scale.paladin['aura-range'].value`)
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) 🤗
* Updated Italian translation by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) 🤗
* Updated Czech translation by [Lethrendis](https://github.com/Lethrendis/) 🤗

## 13.504.7
* Added setting: Automate D&D5e statuses. If disabled (default enabled), AC5e will allow the system or other modules to automate statuses like Blinded, Frightened etc
* Made sure `game.i18n.translations.DND5E` is available
* Reworked `getMessageData`
* Properly added `hasAdvantage`, `hasDisadvantage`, `hasAttack`, `hasDamage`, `isCritical`, `isFumble`, `attackRollTotal`, `attackRollD20` to evaluation conditions
* Fixed `spellcastingAbility` typo
* `scaling` will be either `0` or the system available flag
* Added `spellLevel` to match the system's variable, which is the same like `castingLevel` (`baseSpellLevel` is also available as the spell's base level)
  
## 13.504.6
* Added `isCantrip` boolean for condition evaluation.
* Reworked `castingLevel` to properly reflect the used spell slot/
* Improved `bonus` mode behavior:
  * If the evaluated bonus returns `0`, `false`, or `null`, the Active Effect will be ignored in tooltips (since it wouldn’t affect the roll).
    *  eg when `bonus = opponentActor.attributes.hp.pct > 50 ? 0 : '1d4[acid]'`
  * Acceptable forms:
    * Pure formula: `bonus=1d4[acid] + 5 - 1d2[fire]`. Use when only dice and numeric values are needed.
    * Conditional (evaluated): `bonus=opponentActor.attributes.hp.pct < 50 ? '1d4[acid]' : 22;`. Use string-wrapped dice formulas (`'1d4[acid]'`) or plain numbers when logic is required.

## 13.504.5.2
* Fix for assignment to constant variable.
* Updated Italian translation by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) 🤗
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) 🤗

## 13.504.5.1
* Change to `user` settings instead of per `client` for non-world settings (available for Foundry v13 only)
  * This means that when a specific user is connected, their editable settings will be used, no matter the client they are connecting from.
* Updated Polish translation by [Lioheart](<https://github.com/Lioheart>) 🤗

## 13.504.5
* Added new flags for `max`, `min` modifiers on d20 rolls.
  * usage `flags.automated-conditions-5e.<ACTIONTYPE>.modifier | Override | modifier=rollingActor.attributes.hp.pct < 50 ? 'max12' : 'min8'` which will append to a relevant d20 roll, a `max12` if the rolling actor is below half health, or `min8` otherwise.
  * available also:
    * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.aura.<ACTIONTYPE>.modifier`
    * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.grants.<ACTIONTYPE>.modifier`
  * for <ACTIONTYPE> use one of `attack/check/concentration/death/initiative/save/skill/tool`
* Updated disposition checks. Now the following can be used:
  * `-2`, `-1`, `0`, `1` for exact match based on Foundry's dispositions for SECRET, HOSTILE, NEUTRAL, FRIEDNLY
  * `secret`, `hostile`, `neutral`, `friendly` for exact match of tokens' disposition
  * `ally or same` for relative disposition checks, when both of the tokens need to be of the same disposition
  * `enemy or opposite` for relative disposition checks, which will test between friendly and hostile dispositions only
  * `different` for relative disposition checks, returning all tokens with different dispositions
  * `all` just returns all tokens in range, no matter the disposition
* Fix for healing activities triggering an error when gathering damage types
* Properly evaluate critical threshold additions
* More colorpicker fixes
* Updated Italian translation by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) 🤗
* Updated Polish translation by [Lioheart](<https://github.com/Lioheart>) 🤗

## 13.504.4.1
* Fix for buttons color pickers misbehaving
* Changed default `white` to `#f8f8ff` to remove a warning for not conforming to the required format, until the user click outside of the string field
* added `default` as a keyword to return the default module colors, same like erasing any entry.
  * `default` or delete the entry to get the default module colors
  * `false`, `null`, `0`, `none` to disable the specific attributes color changes
  * `game.user.color` or `user` to match the user's Foundry color


## 13.504.4
* Fix for error when no damage entry exists on a damage roll...
* Updated Czech translation by [Lethrendis](https://github.com/Lethrendis/) 🤗

## 13.504.3
* Fix for `threshold` evaluations
* Fix type `options.damagetypes` => `options.damageTypes`
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) 🤗

## 13.504.2.1
* Added the `...criticalThreshold` flags to be picked up by DAE autocompletion
* Fix for change in `DND5E.ITEM.Property.Heavy` instead of `...Item...`

## 13.504.2
* Added `criticalThreshold` mode for AC5e attack flags, triggered by using keyword `threshold=18` or `threshold=-2` in the effect value, setting to a new if lower static threshold or adding the provided bonus (negative to lower), respectively.
* Added `itemLimited` keyword for ac5e flags, limiting the conditional flag application when the rolling item is the same that applied the effect to the actor.
  * For example, a passive transfer effect from a weapon, adding a damage bonus when that weapon is being used only.
* Changes in Roll Configuration dialogs should trigger proper AC5e re-evaluation of flags
  * Reworked `doDialogSkillOrTollRender` (changes tracked: ability used)
  * Added `doDialogDamageRender` (changes tracked: selected damage type from multiple types)
  * Added `doDialogAttackRender` (changes tracked: Ammunition, Attack Mode, Mastery dropdowns)
* Cleanup of sandbox data to make those work better. Additions:
  * `activity.ability` in the available evaluation data.
  * `attackRollD20` and `attackRollTotal` for grabbing those in damage evaluations after having rolled a d20 to attack.
  * reworked damage types for evaluations based on selected damages from multiple available ones
    * use as `damageTypes.fire || damageTypes.cold` for mutliple ones being true, or `['cold', 'fire'].some(d=>damageTypes[d])`
    * the old way of damage types being readily available is still supported `fire; cold` but using `damageTypes` is recommended and can be more robust
  * `consumptionItemName` and `consumptionItemIdentifier` to be used when an activity consumes uses of another, eg
    * For Dragonhide Belt items consuming Focus uses, `consumptionItemName.Focus` will evaluate to true
* Limit Grappled attacks disadvantage to only modern rules
* Added interim support for min/max system flags for saves and checks until system updates.
* Added proper `Heavy` rules for modern and legacy rules:
  * To disable them use in console `game.settings.set('automated-conditions-5e', 'automateHeavy', false)`
  * For the legacy rules, the `token.document.width * token.document.height * token.document.scale` will need to be lower than `1` in order for the attacking Token to be considered small.
* Allow `bonus` and `radius` to be fully evaluated too, so you could use `radius=auraActor.details.level > 17 ? 30 : 10` for example.
* Verified for Foundry v13.346

## 13.504.1
* System compatibility bump for 5.0.4
* Fix for a forgotten Token instance deprecation
* Added for bonus ac5e flags, support for `effectStacks`, when using DAE or Status Icon Counters stacking of effects.
 * Example `bonus=(effectStacks + 2)d4`

## 13.503.13.3
* Fix for not properly pushing parts for bonuses

## 13.503.13.2
* Added in sandbox:
  * `item.isEnchantment`: Boolean, true if it is an enchantment, or enchanted item.
  * `item.transferredEffects`: Array of transferred effects

## 13.503.13.1
* Guard against actor being undefined at `getActorToolRollModes`

## 13.503.13
* Fix for double initiative bonus and not proper highlighting
* You can now use any of the following in addition to `tokenId` and `opponentId`:
  * `tokenUuid`, `actorId`, `actorUuid` for rolling actor/token identification
  * `opponentUuid`, `opponentActorId`, `opponentActorUuid`

## 13.503.12
* Adds `effectOriginActor` data for bonus flags
  * Usage example: `bonus=effectOriginActor.abilities.wis.mod;`

## 13.503.11.1
* Italian translation update by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) 🤗

## 13.503.11
* v13.345 compatibility

## 13.503.10.4
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) 🤗
* Updated Czech translation by [Lethrendis](https://github.com/Lethrendis/) 🤗

## 13.503.10.3
* Added 2014 Alert automation (checking for Alert - or its translated string for supported languages - item on the actor for Legacy Rules)
* Fix for Transform activities triggering an error

## 13.503.10.2
* Updated French translation by [CaosFR](<https://github.com/CaosFR>) 🤗

## 13.503.10.1
* Compatibility with GPS attacks of opportunity

## 13.503.10
* `paralyzed` and `unconscious` forces damage to be critical only when `activity.hasDamage` returns `true`

## 13.503.9.3
* Updated Czech translation by [Lethrendis](https://github.com/Lethrendis/) 🤗
* Updated Polish translation by [Lioheart](<https://github.com/Lioheart>) 🤗

## 13.503.9.2
* Added `flags.automated-conditions-5e.spellSniper` in the DAE autocomplete options
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) 🤗

## 13.503.9.1
* Added `Spell Sniper` feat (2014 vs 2024) rules
  * `2014`: Spells that have an attack roll, double their range
  * `2024`: Casting a ranged spells within 5 ft of an enemy doesn't impose disadvantage on any attack roll and if the spell has at least 10ft range, gets another 60ft
    * Either an item on the actor named `Spell Sniper` or a relevant flag for `flags.automated-conditions-5e.spellSniper | Override | 1` will cancel the disadvantage.
* Foundry v13.344 compatibility

## 13.503.8.3
* Guard against tokens without an actor

## 13.503.8.2
* Respect Targeting settings for attacks
* Fix for incorrent localization string when targeting is set to cancel and warn

## 13.503.8.1
* Limit uses of AC5e flags on owned actors by a specific Number
  * `once`: adding this keyword in the effect's value, will limit the use of the flag to the next relevant roll only
    * especially useful for any features that trigger a specific behaviour on the next roll by the actor with the effect
    * For example, the actor has advantage in the next Attack, Check, or Save roll (3 entries in one active effect):
      * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.attack.advantage | Override | once`,
      * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.check.advantage | Override | once`,
      * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.save.advantage | Override | once`
  * `usesCount=Number`: will limit the use of the flag to the next \<Number\> of times
  * **BEWARE**:
    * The count will be reduced if the rest of the conditions evaluate to true, no matter what the user selects in any relevant Roll dialog if not fast-forwarding.
    * If the effect is a `transfer: true` one, it will be disabled and if using `usesCount` they will be reset to the initial value
    * Otherwise the effect will be deleted from the Actor when the uses run out!
  * There are future plans for:
    * allowing any Item/Activity uses to be consumed, even from not owned actors.
    * User opt-in flags
* Reworked how the module gets the actors rollData when creating its sandbox for evaluations, so that all the relevant data are included while trying to limit the system's compatibility warnings for `spell.dc` and `spell.mod` is pre-v5.0.0 setups
* Removed some `dialog.configure` handling, until the system fully implements [#5454](<https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/pull/5454>)

## 13.503.7.1
* Italian translation update by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) 🤗

## 13.503.7
* Added global Boolean parameter for `ac5e.logEvaluationData` which if set to true on the client, the available evaluation data will be logged in console after creation. A quick way to familiarize yourselves with what is available to use!
* Tweaked some hooks
* Reworked evaluation data, like `castingLevel`, `baseSpellLevel`, `scaling` and now they are avalable
* Refactor: Limit code duplication by using unified regex-based replacement function.
* Added Czech translation by [Lethrendis](https://github.com/Lethrendis/) 🤗
* Updated Polish translation by [Lioheart](<https://github.com/Lioheart>) 🤗

## 13.503.6
* Properly offer backwards compatibility for `targetActor`
  * Fix for a `currentCombatant` undefined relevant error
* Fix for autoRanged checks always returning ranged attacks in short range
* Small tweaks for `canSee()` which probably now is at a good state 🤞
* Fix for missing `notifyPreUse` function

## 13.503.4.2
* More `canSee()` fixes
* Fix for missing `targetActor` from evaluations
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) 🤗
  
## 13.503.4
* Exposes a checkNearby function to help with Pack Tactics:
  * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.attack.advantage | Override | checkNearby(opponentId, 'different', 5, {count: 2})`
    * `oppenentId` is the targeted token's id
    * `'different'` designates different disposition compared to the target's; can also use `'same'`, `'opposite'` or `'all'`
    * the 3rd passed parameter is the distance to check, `5 units` in this case
    * the 4th parameter is an Object which can include:
       * `count` for the number of tokens to check against
       * `includeToken` (false by default), which adds the target token if needed by passing `includeToken: true`
       * `includeIncapacitated` (false by default), which adds any incapacitated tokens if true
* More visibility testing fixes

## 13.503.3
* Compatibility with combat carousel which calls `actor.rollinitiative()`
* Fix attacks failing due to _canSee() 

## v13.503.2
* Some settings hints clarifications
* Proper 5e versioning bump
* Italian translation update by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) 🤗

## v13.502.2.1
* Fix for using `initiative`, `concentration`, `death` as flag \<ACTIONTYPES\>
* `rollingActor.canMove` (same as `canMove`), `opponentActor.canMove` will be true if the actor has at least one non zero movement type
* Updates in Brazilian Portugese, Italian and Polish translation files
* D&D 5.0.3 compatibility bump

## v13.502.2
* Clarification on Actor References in Evaluations
  * Use `opponentActor` to access the opponent’s rollData during evaluations, instead of `targetActor`.
    * `targetActor` remains available for backwards compatibility, but its usage is now discouraged.
  * This change hopefully improves clarity, especially in cases like saving throws, where the actor rolling the save *can* also be the target of an item roll. For example:
    * during an attack, you have a clear distinction between the attacking actor and the targeted actor.
    * But during saves, the actor rolling the save can also be an actual target, and the other party (e.g., the spellcaster or trap) is better referred to as the opponent.
* Fix for wrong localization string in some settings
* Refactor setpieces code
* Rework `_canSee()` 
* Raging/silenced/incapacitated etc checks fixes
  * `raging`, `silenced`, `no armor proficiency` checks for spell items use
  * `incapacitated` will be checked for activities that have any relevant action as activation cost
* Fix for `subjectTokenId` undefined when no message is created (like initiative rolls)
* Update pt-BR.json by @Kharmans
* Pre use activity issues cleanup
  * the targeting options for attack changes slightly. Now the module will:
    * Use source actor data only if zero or multiple targets are selected when attacking
    * Cancel roll silently
    * Cancel roll with a warning notification shown to the user's client
      * In all cases a console warning will be shown in the user's client
* Adds more data in the sandbox for easier evaluations, like `isSpell` etc to be added in the [WIKI](<https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/wiki>) soon!


## v13.502.1
* Compatibility bump for v5.0.2
* Small fix for not posting more than one warnings, for incapacitated/raging/silenced checks
* Make sure that group or vehicle actors do not break processing
* Updated Italian translation by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) 🤗
  
## v13.501.1.1
* Updated Polish translation by [Lioheart](<https://github.com/Lioheart>) 🤗
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) 🤗
  
## v13.501.1
* Deal with Foundry v13 and dnd5e v5.0.0 deprecations
* Update compatibility and verify module for Foundry v13.342 and 5e v5.0.1
* Exhaustion automation setting will be only available for 5e legacy rules
* New GM setting for visibility of the tooltips in chat messages
  * `All`: players will see tooltips in all chat messages, no matter the actor rolling
  * `None`: players won't see any tooltips in chat messages
  * `Owned`: a player will be able to see tooltips in chat messages for rolls from owned actors
  * `Players`: players will be able to see tooltips in chat messages for rolls from all player owned actors
* Settings tweaks, so Show tooltip module name and Show chat messages tooltips options are available, only when relevant.

## v13.500.4.1
* Hotfix for `ui` in `equippedItems` triggering an error collection...
* Hotfix for the changelog showing an incorrect example of `equippedItems` usage
  * corrected example: `rollingActor.equippedItems.filter(i => i.includes('Platinum')).length > 2` will be true when the rolling actor has more than 2 equipped items with their names including `Platinum`

## v13.500.4
* Guards against `aura` or `grants` flags being evaluated against non relevant actors
* Guards against numerous deprecation warnings being generated for `attributes.spelldc` and `attributes.spellmod` which AC5e doesn't use, but inadvertently triggers when cloning actor.getRollData() objects
* Guards against cases of `undefined: true` being present in the sandbox data
* Adds for flag evaluations:
  * `equippedItems` which is an Array of item names, currently equipped on the actor
    * ie `rollingActor.equippedItems.filter(i => i.includes('Platinum')).length > 2` which will be true when the rolling actor has more than 2 equipped items with their names including `Platinum`
  * `distance` for distance evaluations
    * `distance > 15 && distance <= 20` would be true if the distance between the rolling token and opponent token is between 15 (excluded) and 20 (included), but only when distance is available 
  * `allies`/`enemies` as evaluation conditions for non auras too
     * `allies` will be true for rolls that the rolling token has the **same** disposition compared to its opponent (if an opponent is available for that roll)
     * `enemies` will be true for rolls that the rolling token has a **different** disposition compared to its opponent (if an opponent is available for that roll)
* Updated Italian translation by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) 🤗
* Updated Polish translation by [Lioheart](<https://github.com/Lioheart>) 🤗

## v13.500.3.3
* Damage hook hotfix

## v13.500.3.2
* Some more bugfixes for attack hooks
* Fix for `effectOriginTokenId` evaluations
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) 🤗

## v13.500.3.1
* Normalize roll data evaluations for ac5e flags
 * In bonus mode flags, use:
  * `@` or `rollingActor` to access roll data from the actor rolling, ie `@abilities.dex.mod` or `rollingActor.dex.mod`
  * `##` or `targetActor` to access roll data from a targeted actor (single targeted actor), ie `##attributes.ac.bonus` or `targetActor.attributes.ac.bonus`
  * for auras only, `auraActor` to access roll data from the aura's source actor, ie `auraActor.abilities.cha.mod`
   * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.aura.save.bonus | Override | radius=10;bonus=auraActor.abilities.cha.mod;includeSelf;singleAura;allies` is essentially the level 6 Paladin's Aura of Protection.
* Cleanup parameters pass to private functions
* Concentration flag fixes
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) 🤗

## v13.500.2
* Updated Polish translation by [Lioheart](<https://github.com/Lioheart>) 🤗
* Cleanup in available sandbox data for AC5e flags conditional evaluations
  * `canSee`: evaluates to true if the rolling actor can see the targeted actor
  * `isSeen`: evaluates to true if the targeted actor can see the rolling actor
  * `rollingActor` holds merged data from the `rollingActor.getRollData()` plus the rolling token
  * `targetActor` holds merged data from the `targetActor.getRollData()` plus the targeted token
* The evaluation data is a work in progress and to help users become acquainted, AC5e will be creating a log with its sandbox data everytime a condition evaluation is happening.
  * It will be disabled in the future when the WIKI is ready and the basic available data are set to stone! 

## v13.500.1
* Make sure that when removing blacklisted keywords, an empty string left for evaluation, always evaluates to `true`
  * as a side effect, leaving the effect value of any AC5e flags empty, it will also evaluate to `true`
* Only try to register DAE fields when DAE is actually active
* Foundry v13 and dnd5e 5.0.0 compatibility update
* Updated Italian translation by [GregoryWarn](<https://github.com/GregoryWarn>) 🤗

## v13.439.2
* Proper descriptions fix in DAE fields for auras `radius=`
* Fix for checks being based some times on targeted token's data
* AEs can be named the same and should all be counted
* Updated pt_BR translation by [Kharmans](<https://github.com/Kharmans>) 🤗

## v13.439.1.1
* Slightly more up to date DAE field descriptions for AC5e flags
* Properly evaluate `allies` and `enemies` keywords in flags. Omit for affecting all actors.

## v13.439.1
* That is a huge update, so there might be issues, so please let me know by creating issues in the github repository: [issues](<https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues>)

* Initial implementation for the system's actor abilities/checks roll modes for dis/advantage (not fully supported yet by the system).
  * AC5e will use notice and use any of these flags when present on the rolling actor. 
* AC5E flags:
  * Added flags with descriptions in DAE for autocompletion.
  * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.ACTIONTYPE.MODE`
    * ACTIONTYPE: can be one of `all/attack/check/concentration/damage/death/initiative/save/skill/tool`
    * MODE: can be one of `advantage/disadvantage/bonus/critical/fumble/success/fail`
    * These will be evaluated when the actor that has that active effect on, rolls any of the relevant ACTIONTYPE.
  * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.grants.ACTIONTYPE.MODE`
    * Same ACTIONTYPEs and MODEs as above
    * These will be evaluated when you target the actor that has that active effect on, _granting_ any rolls of the relevant ACTIONTYPE the corresponding MODE.
  * `flags.automated-conditions-5e.aura.ACTIONTYPE.MODE`
    * Same ACTIONTYPEs and MODEs as above
    * These will be evaluated when you are rolling one of the relevant ACTIONTYPEs and the token of an actor that has that active effect on, is in range!
    * The auras need in the change value of the active effect an entry of `radius=15;` for example, to designate the aura's range.
    * You can also include:
      * `singleAura` (mainly for bonus MODE): add that in to make sure that only 1 auras of the same name (the Active Effect's name) can affect the actor rolling, based on higher bonus or closer to the rolling token if of the same bonus.
      * `includeSelf`: add that in if the aura should affect also the actor that has that active effect on.
  * When using `bonus` mode, you should include a bonus entry in the change value, like `bonus=1d4 + abilities.dex.mod` or `bonus=-5[fire]` for typed damage MODE.
  * All the flags can should allow for sync conditional evaluations, based on data from:
    * `rollingActor.getRollData()`
      * If the rolling actor has for example 50 hp, `attributes.hp.value > 40` would evaluate to true
    * `opponentActor.getRollData()` when relevant and under `target`
      * If the target actor has for example 50 hp, `target.attributes.hp.value > 40` would evaluate to true
    * `activity.getRollData()` when relevant
    * `item.getRollData()` when relevant
    * `tokenSize` as the rolling `token.document.width * token.document.height`
    * `tokenElevation`
    * `race`: an Array of the rolling actor's `[value, subtype, swarm, custom, race]` data
    * `targetTokenSize` as the rolling `targetToken.document.width * targetToken.document.height`
    * `targetTokenElevation`
    * `targetRace` an Array of the target's actor's `[value, subtype, swarm, custom, race]` data
    * `activityDamageTypes` which should be returning all the damage types of the relevant activity
    * `activityAttackMode`
    * `activityEffectsStatusRiders` which is a Set of all the statuses that the activity might apply on the target if any
      * So if an attack would apply `poisoned` on a hit, an entry of `activityEffectsStatusRiders.poisoned` would evaluate to true
    * If a combat is active:
      * `isCombatTurn` is true when it's the rolling actor's turn
      * `target.isCombatTurn` same for the target
      * `combat.round/combat.turn/combat.current/combat.turns` will evaluate against the relevant paths in `game.combat`
    * `worldTime` the game.time.worldTime
    * `ability` the ability used on the roll
    * `skill` the skill used on the roll if relevant
    * `tool` the tool used on the roll if relevant
    * `spellLevel` the spell level of casting a spell or the base level of innate ones
  * You can use `ac5e.conditionData({subject: rollingActor, subjectToken: rollingToken, opponent: targetActpr, opponentToken: targetToken, item: rolledItem, activity: rolledActivity, options = {ability, skill, tool,})` to create an image of what data the sandbox for the conditional evaluations would hold.

## v11.315.304.7
Closes [63](https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues/63) with a new setting for `AC5e targeting options`. <br><br>
When 0 or more than 1 targets are selected, AC5e will not be able by default to calculate correctly advantageMode/damageMode as this is done based on the first of the `game.user.targets` only. There is now a setting for the GM to decide how AC5e will deal with targeting and rolling an Attack or Damage, or try to Use an Item that has an attack and Target any of the Individual target options in its details tab. The options are as follows:
   * `From Source Only`: The advantageMode/damageMode will be calculated based on effects/conditions etc on the Source actor only (___default option___),
   * `Do nothing`: No calculations whatsoever will take place,
   * `Enforce targeting`: Will cancel the incoming Roll or Item use, and display a warning for the user to target `1 Target` (___Use with caution___).

## v11.315.304.6.3
* Closes [53](https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues/53)
