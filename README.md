## Description
A Foundry VTT module for the D&D 5e game system that allows status effects and custom AC5e flags to dynamically influence any roll, including attacks, saves, ability checks, and damage. It highlights the correct roll button based on active effects and the 5e ruleset, ensuring rolls are made with the proper advantage, disadvantage, bonuses, or critical damage.

The module supports **auras** and **granting modes** that can affect nearby allies or enemies, automatically applying condition-based bonuses, penalties. etc. AC5e flags allow evaluation of data from the rolling actor, opposing actor, and aura source actors ‚Äî enabling automation of more complex, context-sensitive scenarios.

## Dnd5e Conditions supported
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The module will adjust it's behaviour based on the 5e system's setting, for Modern vs Legacy rules.
For example if Modern rules are selected, AC5E will not handle Exhaustion, but respect the system's handling.
Small adjustments for differences in the rest of the conditions too, as needed.

<details>
  <summary><b>Legacy Rules</b></summary>
  
- `Blinded`: Disadvantage on attacks and grants advantage to attack from others
- `Exhaustion 1`: Disadvantage on ability checks (and skill checks as a result)

## AC5e flags: `flags.automated-conditions-5e`
Using the offered module flags in Active effects, you can affect rolls of actors, against actors or actors within the range of auras!!

More info in: <https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/wiki/Flags-functionality>

> üí° If you have DAE module enabled, the flags can be auto completed in the DAE effect sheets.

## Module Settings
<details>
  <summary><b>Quick walkthrough</b></summary>
  
- `Expanded Conditions` **(default off)**
  - `Dodging`: Attacker disadvantage if target not incapacitated, restrained and can see attacker (attacker doesn't have the Hiding condition). Also advantage on dex saves.
  - `Hiding`: Advantage on attacks.
- `Armor automation` **(default off)**
  - Ability Checks, Saves and Attack Rolls for (STR || DEX) based rolls, if the Actor is not proficient in the equipped suit of Armor.
  - Imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks when the relevant property of the Armor is selected.
  - From dnd5e v3.1.2 onwards, any Equipment type Item can impose stealth disadvantage too, not only Armor.
- `Casting spells checks automation` **(default Do nothing)**
  - When rolling a spell item, checks for:
    - Not being proficient in the equipped armor,
    - Raging (or Rage) active effect,
    - Silenced status and neither an active effect named Subtle Spell (localized), nor a `flags.automated-conditions-5e.subtleSpell | Override | 1`.
  - If set to `Enforce`, if any of the above are true, spell's use will be disallowed.
  - If set to `Warn`, there will be just a warning toast instead.
  - If set to `Do nothing`, well why should it do something?! :D
- `Range automation` **(default off)**
  - Attacking with a ranged weapon at long range imposes disadvantage on the roll (`Long Range`).
  - Attacking with a ranged weapon, when an enemy is adjacent, imposes disadvantage on the roll (`Nearby Foe`);
    - Added a separate setting for Nearby Foe (default off).
  - Attacking with a ranged weapon at a distance longer than the long range, imposes a fail on the roll (`Out of Range`).
  - Crossbow Expert: Ignores Nearby Foes with
    - A flag on the Actor `flags.automated-conditions-5e.crossbowExpert | Override | 1` or
    - An Item named `Crossbow Expert`.
  - Sharpshooter: No disadvantage when shooting at long range with
    - A flag on the Actor `flags.automated-conditions-5e.sharpShooter | Override | 1` or
    - An Item named `Sharpshooter`.
- `Show AC5e tooltips` for both Roll Dialog and Chat messages or any combination of these **(default both)**
- `Exhaustion automation` **(default on)**
  - If you want to not automatically process Exhaustion conditions uncheck this. Doing so will allow for other exhaustion modules to alter exhaustion automation or your own rules (eg [Alternative Exhaustion 5e](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/alternative-exhaustion-5e)).
- `Encumbrance automation` **(default off)**
  - Dnd5e v3.x system offers a setting for Encumbrance rules. If that is set to `Variant`, and you turn this AC5e setting on, ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution will have disadvantage.
- `Targeting options` **(default From source only)**
  - When 0 or more than 1 targets are selected, AC5e will not be able by default to calculate correctly advantageMode/damageMode as this is done based on the first of the game.user.targets only. There is now a setting for the GM to decide how AC5e will deal with targeting and rolling an Attack or Damage, or try to Use an Item that has an attack and Target any of the Individual target options in its details tab. The options are as follows:
    - `From Source Only`: The advantageMode/damageMode will be calculated based on effects/conditions etc on the Source actor only (default option),
    - `Do nothing`: No calculations whatsoever will take place,
    - `Enforce targeting`: Will cancel the incoming Roll or Item use, and display a warning for the user to target 1 Target (Use with caution).
- **For D&D5e v3.1**
  - Added¬†`dnd5e.preRollConcentration` hook to deal with conditions affecting concentration saving throws.
    - Exhaustion 3-5 applies disadvantage.
    - Heavy Encumbrance applies disadvantage.
    - War Caster named Item applies advantage.
